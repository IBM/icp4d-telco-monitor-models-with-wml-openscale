Businesses today are increasingly certain that AI will be a driving force in the evolution of their industries over the next few years. To successful infuse AI into your product or solution, there are many factors that challenges its widespread adoption in the business and to achieving their expected outcomes. A few are listed below:

  1. Building trust - Organizations and businesses tend to be skeptical about AI because of its "black box" nature, resulting in many promising models no going into production.
  1. Algorithm bias - Another inherent problem with AI systems is that they are only as good – or as bad – as the data they are trained on. If the input data is filled with racial, gender, communal or ethnic biases, your model's accuracy is going to eventually drift away.
  1. Making decisions explainable - How can the model prove the reasoning behind its decision-making? It is critical that AI outcomes are fully explainable by keeping a complete track of the inputs and outputs of any AI-powered application.

What if there is one console that makes it easier for business users to track and measure AI outcomes?

In this code pattern we demonstrate a way to monitor your AI models in an application using Watson OpenScale. This will be demonstrated with an example of a Telecomm Call Drop Prediction Model. After the user has completed the code pattern, they will learn:

* How to store custom models using open source technology on Watson Machine Learning.
* How to deploy a model and connect the model deployment to Watson OpenScale on Cloud Pak for Data and on IBM Cloud.
* How to setup Model Fairness and Model Quality montiors with Watson OpenScale on Cloud Pak for Data and on IBM Cloud, using a python notebook.
* How to create a project and setup a python notebook on Cloud Pak for Data.

### 5. Follow the steps in the notebook

You will run cells individually by highlighting each cell, then either click the `Run` button at the top of the notebook. While the cell is running, an asterisk (`[*]`) will show up to the left of the cell. When that cell has finished executing a sequential number will show up (i.e. `[17]`).

> **NOTE**: For reference, we have included a completed notebook in the `/examples` directory of this repo. This version of the notebook includes all the executed steps and outputs. See [https://github.com/IBM/icp4d-telco-monitor-models-with-wml-openscale/blob/master/examples/Setup_your_AIOS_Dashboard-Example.jupyter-py36.ipynb](https://github.com/IBM/icp4d-telco-monitor-models-with-wml-openscale/blob/master/examples/Setup_your_AIOS_Dashboard-Example.jupyter-py36.ipynb)

#### Install the Necessary Packages

* Click on the `Run` icon and install the necessary packages described in the first 3 cells.
* Next, restart your kernel by either clicking the restart icon or `Kernel > Restart`.

#### Add the Dataset

In section `2.2 Add Dataset`, highlight the blank cell by clicking on it. Click on the *10/01* button to select a specific data set.

Choose the `Local` tab, and select the `call_drop_data_train.csv` file that you added to the project. Under the `Insert to code` option, click `Insert Pandas DataFrame`.

> **IMPORTANT**:  Ensure the variable name is set to `df_data_1`.

#### Supply the neccessary variables and credentials

  > **NOTE**: These credentials will **only** be used if you have **not** already configured your Watson OpenScale Datamart. As you will see in section `4.3 Setup the Datamart on AI OpenScale`, if the Datamart already exists, it will be used. If not, the notebook will create the Datamart, using these credentials to configure it.
  
### For CPD v2.5 users-

* Run all cells in the notebook till `4. Create a new Deployment Space`
* After that follow the steps in the documentation to obtain the Deployment Space name and insert into the notebook cell
 ![enter dep name](/doc/src/images/dep_name.png)
 
* Run the rest of the notebook as per the rest of the instructions

#### Add the Subscription ID

* Continue running the notebook up to section `4.5 Create a new Subscription`.
* Before runnning the remaining cells (again, please keep in mind it is better run cell by cell), update the variable `subscription_id` in section `4.6 Perform Inital Payload Logging`, with the ID you created in the previous cell.
* You will find this id in the table above the cell, as instructed in the notebook.
* Now, run the rest of the notebook to completion.

### 6. Display deployment in Watson OpenScale

  ![open_openscale](doc/src/gif/openopenscale.gif)

* You will see the initial setup looking like this:

  ![initial_dashboard](doc/src/images/initial_dashboard.png)

### 7. Additional use-case for Watson OpenScale

Included in the data directory of this repo is a file named [Telco_training_final.csv](https://github.com/IBM/icp4d-telco-monitor-models-with-wml-openscale/blob/master/data/Telco_training_final.csv)). This contains call drop data for multiple cell towers. If you filter the data on the field `outgoing_site_id`, you can create a file for each cell tower you would like to monitor. Using the same notebook, you can create a new deployment for each model.

In the following description, we show a dashboard that consists of call drop prediction models for 3 different towers - A, B and C.

OpenScale is configured so that it can monitor how your models are performing over time. The following screen shot gives one such snapshot:

   ![dashboard_initial](doc/src/images/dashboard_initial.png)

As we can see, the model for Tower C demonstrates a fairness bias warning of 92%.

#### What is a fairness-bias and why do we need to mitigate it?

Data in this day and age comes from a wide variety of sources. Being able to give the right input to a machine learning model is crucial to generating a succesful machine learning implementation in an application. However, if the underlying data is biased in any form, there is a risk that structural inequalities and unfair biases are not just replicated, but also amplified.

Hence, Watson OpenScale is useful when you need to identify the bias, in real-time (i.e., when payload flows into your machine learning system).

Now, that we have identified a bias, let us see the consequence of the bias and what exactly is causing the bias in this example.

##### Understanding bias

Select the desired deployment using `options > View Details`. You will see a full dashboard with various charts telling you how your model has been performing over various time intervals.

You may not receive the same values as the below screenshots. Since we have only done an initial setup, you will have only see one line in your charts.

   ![details](doc/src/images/Details.png)

Now select `_conds` in the `Fairness` menu on the left side. If you hover over the graph, you can select `Click to view details`. Select a timeline according to your current date.

To interpret the details, have a look at the screenshot below:

   ![bias](doc/src/images/bias.png)

Our dataset contains the fields: `Clear`,`Fog`,`Haze`, `Partly Cloudy`, and `Rain`. The graph above suggests the field `Fog` contains a bias.

##### So, what does this really mean?

As we can see with the legend, we have the `Favorable Outcome` and `Unfavorable Outcome`. With this bias value we see that with the field value `Fog` compared to the values has a lesser % of favorable outcomes. Why does this affect my model? It creates a disparity and thereby allows your model to be biased towards the unfavorable outcome (in the case of `fog`).

##### Ok, so why does it really matter to me?

The best way to explain the consequence of the disparity is by taking this example - suppose we allow the disparity to creep in. Our model will slowly start believing that the moment the weather condition is foggy, it needs to predict the unfavorable outcome(1), and in this case the call will drop. Now, this may not be the case in reality. There maybe other conditions along with the fog that is causing call drops. Hence, it is important to keep monitoring your machine learning model on a real-time basis.

#### Understanding quality monitors

Now click on the `View Transactions` button shown in the previous screen shot. You will be presented with a list of each transaction. A transaction is basically the records
of all the data that flows into your model. It gives you the logs and if there is a bias identified, it will also be specified.

##### How to see your model performance

Come back to the dashboard and explore the `Area under ROC` section. Again, hover over the graph and select `Click to view details`.

  ![quality](doc/src/images/quality.png)

In this example, we have setup only the `Area under ROC` as a quality measure. As shown in the above image.

You will receive estimates and the configured quality montor values, as shown below. The image shows the overall `True Positive` and `False Positive` ratio for the monitored model.
